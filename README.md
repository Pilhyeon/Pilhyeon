### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pilhyeon Lee.

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, Korea.
I worked as a research intern in Microsoft Research Asia, China.
I received the B.S. degree at Chung-Ang University, Korea.
My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, video understanding, and weakly-supervised learning.
