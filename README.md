### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pilhyeon Lee.

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University.
Also, I am collaborating as a visiting researcher with the video understanding team at CLOVA AI research.
In the past, I worked as a research intern in Microsoft Research Asia.
I received the B.S. degree at Chung-Ang University.
My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, video understanding, and weakly-supervised learning.
