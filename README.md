### üëã Hi, I'm Pilhyeon Lee (Ïù¥ÌïÑÌòÑ).

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University.
In the past, I collaborated as a visiting researcher with the video understanding team at CLOVA AI research, Naver Corporation.
Also, I was fortunate to work as a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia.
I received my B.S. degree at Chung-Ang University.
My research interests include computer vision, video understanding, multimodal learning, and weakly-supervised learning.
